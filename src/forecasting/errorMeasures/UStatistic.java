/**
 * Theilâ€™s U statistic is a relative accuracy measure that compares the forecasted results with the results of forecasting with minimal historical data.
 * It also squares the deviations to give more weight to large errors and to exaggerate errors, which can help eliminate methods with large errors.
 * <p>
 * <1: The forecasting technique is better than guessing.
 * 1: The forecasting technique is about as good as guessing.
 * >1: The forecasting technique is worse than guessing.
